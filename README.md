## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 

The realiability of UDP decreases. Approximately half of the packets are able to be received by the client. That occurs because the command makes the server to drop 50 percent of its packet while it is sending them.

Answer for Question 2:
TCP remains its reliability because TCP would make sure that the client always receives the packet. If the packets are lost, TCP would make the server resend them until they are received by the client.

Answer for Question 3:
The speed of the response time decreases because the server constantly drops 50 percent of its sent packets. The server has to resend again and again which makes the response time longer. Also, the fact that TCP requires client to present data in order makes the response time longer . The arrived packets have to wait to be presented until all of their prior ones are received.
